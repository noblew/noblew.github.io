    <span>Hello there.</span>
    <br>
    <span>My name is Noble Wulffraat, and this my very minimal website.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Here's a bit about me and some things I've worked on</span>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <span>I'm a recent graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I studied Mathematics. I received my bachelors in Math with a minor in Computer Science in August 2023 and I'm hoping to put it to good use.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>I'm interested in a lot of different subfields within CS and software engineering and I like to jump around between them. As a software engineer intern at Walmart I worked with the Walmart Pay team on their Android app and prototyped a Bluetooth Low Energy integration for point-of-sale pairing.
        Before that I worked with a research group at <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/igl"> IGL </a> on developing a library for the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">LEAN</a> theorem prover to more easily encode model theory proofs. 
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>I'm currently looking for software engineering roles or any role that involves solving interesting problems with computers.</span>
